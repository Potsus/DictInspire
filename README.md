# DictInspire
A quick webapp to come up with ideas

I used some code fu to get all of the nouns and gerends from a dictionary.
now just for fun lets stick them together to create an idea generator.

Todo:
add some more modes like 
<noun> for <gerend>
 and
<startup> but for <any word>
and select which mode to use at random
